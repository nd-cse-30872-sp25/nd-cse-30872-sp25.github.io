    **Everyone**:

    Next week, we will work on problems related to "complete search", that is
    trying out every possibility and testing them.  Although [brute-force]
    search may feel wrong, sometimes the most straightforward solution is the
    best one.  To perform a "complete search" we will need the ability to
    generate each combination and the ability to perform [backtracking].  These
    techniques will come in handy for solving [Challenge 07] and [Challenge
    08].
