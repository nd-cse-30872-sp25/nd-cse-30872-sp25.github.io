    **Everyone**:

    Welcome to [CSE 30872 Programming Challenges], which (as the syllabus
    states) is a "course that revolves around solving *brain-teaser* and
    *puzzle-type* problems that often appear in programming contests, online
    challenges, and job interviews".  What this means is that we will be
    studying common data structures, algorithms, and programming techniques
    that are useful in tackling a variety of problems.

    Additionally, this semester we will also learn about different software
    development techniques such as debugging, testing, profiling, and
    packaging.

    <div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">

    #### <i class="fa fa-bookmark"></i> TL;DR

    For this week, you should familiarize yourself with using [Slack], setup
    your [GitHub] assignments repository, read about I/O and complexity, and
    then submit your responses to the [Reading 00 Quiz].

    </div>

    ## Course Overview

    Last semester, many of you took the **Data Structures** course where you
    learned about the properties and characteristics of different data
    structures (and perhaps you even implemented a few).  The focus of this
    class, however, is not in the *construction* of these data structures, but
    rather their *application*.  This means we will focus on *when* to use
    these data structures and algorithms and *how* to utilize them effectively
    rather than *what* they are.  In concrete terms, we will not be
    implementing say a [hash table]; instead we will use one to solve a variety
    of problems.

    Following the [Hands-On Imperative], you will have the opportunity to put
    the material we discuss in class into practice via a *respectful* number of
    weekly **programming challenges** (**two a week**).  Along with these
    challenges will be **reading assignments** to ensure you have a context or
    background knowledge for what we will be discussing in class.  As with last
    semester in [Systems Programming], the reading assignments will be
    automatically graded.

    In fact all of your assignments will be automatically graded by [dredd] via
    the [continuous integration] system provided by [GitHub].  As you may have
    experienced during your internship this summer, **testing** is an important
    part of software engineering and we will therefore explore various aspects
    of **software development** including debugging, profiling, testing,
    packaging and more throughout the semester (*if there is time*).

    Although each class will involve some amount of lecture, there will also be
    a lot of in-class activities and hands-on learning.  Because of this, you
    are expected to come to class **regularly** and **on-time**.

    Fortunately, however, there are **no exams** in this class.  Instead, we
    will have **two in-class programming contests** where you will get to work
    in groups of `3` (similar to the [ACM Programming Contest]).  Likewise, you
    will also have to participate in **two practice interviews** such
    as those provided by the career center.

    ## Task 1: Slack

    For communication outside of our meeting time, we will be using [Slack],
    specifically the `#cse-30872-sp25` channel:

    > [https://nd-cse.slack.com/messages/cse-30872-sp25/](https://nd-cse.slack.com/messages/cse-30872-sp25/)

    There is a [class mailing list], but most day-to-day communication
    (including office hours and homework help) should take place on [Slack].

    [class mailing list]: mailto:sp25-cse-30872-01-group@nd.edu

    <div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
    <p>Be aware of the following:</p><br>

    - You will need to signup and create a [Slack] account if you don't already
      have one.

    - You can use the web interface or download the [Slack] desktop client
      (there are also mobile applications as well).

    - Feel free to join any other channels that may interest you such as
      `#commons` or `#jobs`.

    </div>

    ## Task 2: GitHub

    All of your work will be submitted to [GitHub] using [git]. Your third task
    is to setup your [GitHub] repository by doing the following:

    1. **Sign-in** or **create** a [GitHub] account if you do not already have one.

    2. **Fork** the class assignments repository from the following template:

        > [https://classroom.github.com/a/v94b1cJe](https://classroom.github.com/a/v94b1cJe)

        This will create a **private** `assignments-$USERNAME`
        repository under your own account and linked to the [nd-cse-30872-sp25]
        organization.

    3. Once this is done, you can [clone] your [git] repository to your local
    machine (or the **student** machines:

            :::bash
            $ git clone git@github.com:nd-cse-30872-sp25/assignments-$USERNAME.git

        <div class="alert alert-danger" markdown="1">
        **Note**, that [GitHub] has recently shutdown [password authentication].
        </div>

        To remotely access your repository from the command-line, you have two options:

        1. [Setup a Personal Access Token]: With this method, [GitHub] will
          generate an application specific password that you can use with
          **HTTPS**.  As the **PAT** is a long string of characters, it is
          recommended that you use it in conjunction with a **password
          manager** or **keyring**.

        2. [Setup SSH Keys]: With this method, you generate a local public and
          private key pair on your computer and then upload the **public key**
          to [GitHub].  When accessing [GitHub] from the command-line, you will
          use the **private key** to authenticate to the server.  This is the
          **recommended** way to setup your repository as it will allow for
          **passwordless** access.

        <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">
        #### <i class="fa fa-lock"></i> Setup SSH Keys

        <p>Here is a quick tutorial on how to [Setup SSH Keys] on the student
        machines (if you have not already):</p>

        1. Generate SSH keys if you don't have them yet:

                :::bash
                # Accept the defaults, don't make a password if you want to go passwordless
                $ ssh-keygen

        2. Copy the contents of `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` to the SSH Keys section of
        your [GitHub] settings page:

            > [https://github.com/settings/keys](https://github.com/settings/keys)

                :::bash
                # Copy and paste the contents of this file into GitHub
                $ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

        3. Edit/create `~/.ssh/config` to use this key with [GitHub]:

                :::bash
                # Add the following to your config (replace $NETID with your netid)
                $ $EDITOR ~/.ssh/config
                Host github.com
                        User git
                        Hostname github.com
                        PreferredAuthentications publickey
                        IdentityFile /escnfs/home/$NETID/.ssh/id_rsa

        Once this is done, you should be able to do [git] operations without a password.
        You will need to accept the host key the first time by typing in "yes".
        </div>

        <div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">

        **Note**: Please update the `README.md` file to include your **name**
        and **NetID** so it is straightforward to identify your account.

    #### <i class="fa fa-github"></i> GitHub Repository

    You are responsible for ensuring that your [GitHub] assignments repository
    is in proper order, which means you have the correct settings and
    permissions set.  Failure to properly configure your repository will
    adversely impact your grade.

    ## Task 3: Reading

    The readings for **Monday, January 13th** are

    1. [CSE 30872 Programming Challenges (Spring 2025)](index.html)

    2. [Competitive Programmer's Handbook]

        - Chapter 1 Introduction

        - Chapter 2 Time Complexity

    <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">
    **Note**: Don't worry if you don't get the readings done by Monday, as
    this is the first week of class.
    </div>

    ## Task 4: Quiz

    Once you have done the readings, answer the following [Reading 00 Quiz]
    questions:

    <div id="quiz-questions"></div>

    <div id="quiz-responses"></div>

    <script src="static/js/dredd-quiz.js"></script>
    <script>
    loadQuiz('static/json/reading00.json');
    </script>

    <pre style="display: none;" id="dr-container" class="codehilite"><code id="dredd-response"></code></pre>

    To submit your answers, you will need create a `answers.json` or
    `answers.yaml` file in the `reading00` folder of your **assignments**
    repository:

    1. For this class, you must use a **separate [git] branch for each
    assignment**.  This means that the work for each reading and challenge must
    be done in a separate branch.  To create and checkout a new branch, you can
    do the following:

            :::bash
            $ git checkout master         # Make sure we are in master branch
            $ git pull --rebase           # Make sure we are up-to-date with github repository

            $ git checkout -b reading00   # Create reading00 branch and check it out

        Once you do the above, you should see the following output for the
        [git-branch] command:

            :::bash
            $ git branch
              master
            * reading00

        The `*` indicates that we are currently on the `reading00` branch.

    2. You can either hand-write the `answers` file using your favorite text
    editor or you can use the online form to generate the [JSON] data.

        A hand-written `answers.yaml` may look like the following:

            :::text
            q1:     [python,perl,ruby]
            q2:     [n2,nf,nlogn,1,n,sqrtn,logn]
            q3:     n
            q4:     n

        The equivalent `answers.json` generated using the online form may look
        like the following:

            :::json
            {
              "q1": [
                "python",
                "perl",
                "ruby"
              ],
              "q2": [
                "n2",
                "nf",
                "nlogn",
                "1",
                "n",
                "sqrtn",
                "logn"
              ],
              "q3": "n",
              "q4": "n"
            }

        You may use either format.  To determine which symbols correspond to
        which response, take a look at the [Reading 00 Quiz] file.

        To check your answers, you can use the provided `.scripts/check.py`
        script:

            :::bash
            $ cd reading00                        # Go into reading00 folder
            $ $EDITOR answers.json                # Edit your answers.json file

            $ ../.scripts/check.py                # Submit reading00
            Checking reading00 quiz ...
                  Q1 0.14
                  Q2 0.14
                  Q3 0.00
                  Q4 0.00
                  Q5 0.00
               Score 0.29 / 3.00
              Status Failure

        This script will send your `reading00/answers.json` file to [dredd],
        which is the automated grading system.  [dredd] will take your answers
        and return to you a score as shown above.  Each reading is worth
        **3.0** points.

        <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">
        **Note**: You may check your quiz answers as many times as you want;
        [dredd] does not keep track of who checks what or how many times.  It
        simply returns a score.
        </div>

    3. Once you have your answers file, you need to add, commit the file, and
    push your commits to [GitHub]:

            :::bash
            $ git add answers.json                # Add answers.json to staging area
            $ git commit -m "Reading 00: Done"    # Commit work

            $ git push -u origin reading00        # Push branch to GitHub

        <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">
        **Note**: You may edit and commit changes to your branch as many times
        as you wish.  Just make sure all of your work goes in the appropriate
        branch and then perform a `git push` when you are done.
        </div>

    4. When you are ready for your final submission, you need to create a
    **pull request** via the [GitHub] interface:

        - First, go to your repository's **Branches** page and then press the
        **New pull request** button for the appropriate branch:

            <div class="thumbnail">
            <img src="static/img/pr_step_1.png" class="img-responsive"/>
            </div>

        - Next, edit the **pull request** title to "Reading 00", write a
          comment if necessary and then press the "Create pull request" button.

            <div class="thumbnail">
            <img src="static/img/pr_step_2.png" class="img-responsive"/>
            </div>

        - Finally, assign the **pull request** to the **teaching assistant**
          assigned to you for the given week and make sure all the checks have
          **passed**.

            <div class="thumbnail">
            <img src="static/img/pr_step_3.png" class="img-responsive"/>
            </div>

        - Every commit on [GitHub] will automatically check your quiz or code with
          [dredd] and the results of each run is displayed in the **Checks** tab
          of each commit as shown below:

            <div class="thumbnail">
            <img src="static/img/pr_step_4.png" class="img-responsive"/>
            </div>

    <div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
    #### <i class="fa fa-gavel"></i> Graders

    Please refer to the [Reading 00 TA List](reading00_tas.html) to determine
    who your grader is for this week.

    </div>

    Once you have made the **pull request**, the instructor or teaching
    assistant can verify your work and provide feedback via the discussion form
    inside the **pull request**.  If necessary, you can update your submission
    by simply committing and pushing to the appropriate branch; the **pull
    request** will automatically be updated to match your latest work.

    When all work is graded, the grader will merge your branch and close the
    **pull request**.

    <div class="alert alert-danger" markdown="1">
    **Note**: Please **do not merge** your own **pull request**.  This makes it
    more difficult for the graders to keep track of what needs to be graded.
    </div>

    <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">

    #### <i class="fa fa-thumbs-up"></i> Qualitative Feedback

    The purpose of this workflow is to provide you with better feedback.
    Instead of simply determining if your work is correct, the instructor will
    attempt to provide you with more **qualitative feedback** such as whether
    or not you used good programming practices or if your code could be
    improved or organized better.

    The hope is that this will help you grow as programmers and develop some
    **taste** :).
